Programming and data science are the two paths where I've wanted to get my life and career to focus. 

When you're self-passed, sometimes it's easy to lose the way. That's why I decided to start writing everything I saw, to look back the steps where I started and help others too.

Why did people start programming?

Basically, some of the main reasons why people start programming was the work they were developing, looking for new ways to solve problems and creating new things for covering necesities that weren't attended.

When the need to code emerges is to solve a problem. To solve a problem, find the solution must be the main objective and this could be represent throught a function.
A function is a purpose for an object, a product and a result. It's important not to lose the focus of what a function searchs.

As an exercise provided in Codedoor.org, some of the functions I encounter for this products are:

- Lyft: give transportation services
- Pizza Hut: offer pizza
- Hotels: a place to sleep
- Smartphones: applications and data access besides the phone features.
